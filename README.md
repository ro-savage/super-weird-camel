# Runn Pair Programming Exercise

You will be asked to create a basic app / feature that is similar to some of the problems we solve every day working at Runn. You will be driving, with an engineer from Runn helping you when you get stuck, giving you advice, and ensuring you don't go off track. While you are primary problem solver, we are here to help so please ask for it.

This is also open-book and real world, please do google, look up docs, and talk to our follow engineer to talk through problems are get advice. You can use any additional libraires you like (but dont get bogged down on this). There is no 'solution' to this -- like in the real world, it just needs to meet specifications.

There is no end to the assignment, it is purely limited by time -- the person you're working with will continue giving you tasks to improve and add features to the app. They will be deliberately giving tasks which they think will help them better understand you as an engineer.

## The Exercise
We want to allow our users to create "Assignments", display this assignments on the screen, and then view them through a various of lens.

You'll be building everything - The UI, the form, the calculations and visuals. We are just looking for a very basic page, and you can use any liberies you might find helpful.

You don't need to make it fancy and you don't need to dive too deep into edge cases or performance optomisations.

Feel free to mention what you might do, or the interviewer might through in an edge case, or ask for an optomisation when they want to explore some of your knowledge deeper.

Generally its easiest to follow the specs in order -- but it's up to you.

## Tasks

1. Create a way for users to create assignments. Assignments have the following properties: Description, Hours Per Day, Start Date, End Date. The user should be able to save the assignment - but the data is not yet displayed anywhere.

Additional tasks will be communicated as we go.
